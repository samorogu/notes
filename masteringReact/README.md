## Introduction

This notes are my summary from the [mastering react course](https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react).
In the next sections I will put my path while learning React. After installing npm with react-app module `npm i -g create-react-app` and visual studio code with the extensions prettier and simple react snippets lets create our first react app.

Because I was using a old version of node, I had to update it. In my windows computer I had to do the following [instrucctions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18412129/how-can-i-update-npm-on-windows)

and had to execute as adminitrator in powershell `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope CurrentUser -Force`

```bash
create-react-app counter-app
```
